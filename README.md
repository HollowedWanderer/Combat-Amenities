Don't hesitate to report issues or suggestions [here](https://github.com/HollowedWanderer/Combat-Amenities/issues)! It really helps me out a lot! 

# Features
Combat Amenities aims to improve combat with some small tweaks.

### Feature List:
- **Back Slot** - A back slot to display weapons to your friends while also having them on standby with a quick keybind! The item in your back slot is visible in third person on your back, and in first person via an offhand-like slot on the right side of your hotbar

- **Trident Tweaks** - Tridents now return to the correct slot, the slot they were thrown from! When using riptide, offhand items are hidden in first person to prevent them from blocking visibility

### Forge Port
I will not be porting this mod to forge, however, it is compatible with Sinytra Connector, so it is still usable in Forge/Neoforge modpacks!

Probably not going to update the 1.20.1 version to 2.0.0 - too much to manage and newer updates are dropping

Also ty Famine for the unsheath sound!
